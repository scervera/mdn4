        <p>MDN’s Discipleship Boot Camp<sup>&#174;</sup> is a powerful, often life changing event in which men from all over the region come together to be challenged by the Word of God delivered through engaging, powerful, and inspired speakers and pastors. You will experience the power of brotherhood with men who share one common bond: Jesus Christ. Come as you are. There are none perfect here (Romans 3:10); just men recognizing their need of the Savior and a desire to become more like Him. Discipleship Boot Camp<sup>&#174;</sup>  is fun. You will laugh until you cry, and you will cry until you laugh as you experience the grace of Christ in your life. Come and be among the multitude of men called by God to gather "for such a time as this”. Come! Be “The Man God Blesses”.</p>

In that moment, he committed to the task of preserving ancient Biblical texts & manuscripts for both study and reference.
Born in the 1950’s, Dan was brought up in a christian home with a family filled with ministers and missionaries. His own path eventually led him to becoming one of the most respected Personal Injury attorneys in the country. With a family history that was rooted deeply in ministry and he, himself spending most of his life defending people in a court room, it seemed only natural for Dan to pursue a Masters Degree in Theology. His once teacher now friend, Ravi Zacharias, inspired Dan to continue in his pursuit of helping others defend their faith and to truly understand why they believe, what they believe. Dan has toured the country with his traveling museum of preserved ancient Biblical texts & manuscripts with the mission of making the Word of God as accessible as possible to the people of God.

Our wives have only one husband, our children one father. One of the challenges facing every man is his need to engage his family each week in a time devotion to God’s Word. Tim Shoemaker will teach you practical, applicable methods that have already worked for thousands of men across the country. You just may laugh as much as you learn. Tim uses a huge variety of object lessons to help teach men biblical truth—like electrocuting a pickle, creating a -100 degree solution for fast-freezing, and converting a leaf blower to shoot toilet paper. These demos, often done with the help of a volunteer from the audience, really connect with men. And men tend to remember the application better as well.</br></br>
