							MDN Discipleship Boot Camp is a rally point for the men of your church to gather together, to be challenged by truth that transforms, and to unite as a cohesive team having shared a live changing experience. 
							
						</strong>
						<p>
							Discipleship Boot Camp<sup>&#174;</sup> is a one day large catalytic event that draws men from many churches and denominations. Since 1996 more than 100,000 men have been biblically trained through these events. The power of relevant field-tested ministry to men challenges the lies men live with biblical truth that cannot be addressed on Sunday morning. The Discipleship Boot Camps<sup>&#174;</sup> are held one to two times a year in the region with the nation’s top men’s speakers. Success is only measured by a transformed life, not Sundays, but Tuesday at 2 pm.

								Men of God, we all experience the same struggles – we are in this together. Wgeb attending a DBC you will hear truth that will help you disarm the lie that you are alone in your struggle. Men can choose from 8-10 workshops to interact with other men and be encouraged and strengthened.

								The many voices of our culture try to dictate to us lies about who we are, why we exist and what is our purpose. We are mandated by Scripture to not be conformed to this culture and its false promises, but rather we are to be transformed (Romans 12:2). At DBC you will hear “Truth that Transforms with Training that Sustains” that truth.

								The Bible teaches that we are opposed by an unseen enemy who seeks to Steal, Kill and Destroy (John 10:10). Men will walk away from this event equipped with practical tools to overcome the enemy of our souls.

								As men, we can all go through seasons in our life where we feel like we are walking through a desert. Sometimes all we need to overcome such seasons is to “suit up and show up.” At DBC you will be refreshed through masculine worship, renewed in your spirit through the teachings as well as be affirmed through prayer. You will leave motivated in your faith and encouraged to “keep on keeping on.”

It showed our men to follow God's leadership and authority in our life and how to unite as one for a common purpose - God. After this weekend’s workshop the men re-united and came together setting aside their differences. It really made a difference.

It’s wonderful to see the many men from different Christian denominations participate. The exploratory presentation of the materials were clear, meaningful and comprehensible. Pastors whose Churches embrace this material lay the ground work for men using serious bible based materials which connects them with their God and fellow brothers, which promotes spiritual wellness in our church communities.
