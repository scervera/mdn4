								W.E.A.P.O.N.S.® Curriculum for men is a life-changing curriculum that is rooted in Christ-centered manhood, providing vital truth that transforms a man with training that sustains it. 
							
						</strong>
						<p>
							This Scripture-drenched course is founded on 20 years of ministry to men by Men’s Pastor, Scott Caesar and has a proven blueprint to revive a man’s soul, growing and maturing in Biblical manhood. The comprehensive, step-by-step videos are designed to assist the teacher and his core leaders to minister more effectively to their men through a system of challenging but practical training to equip, engage and teach men. The format consists of masculine-themed teaching, combined with man-life parables, interactive workshops with discussion/application times. It provides a sustainable system of accountable brotherhood that is built to last and a supported game plan of consistent Bible engagement for men.

						</p>
						<p>
							Thousands of men have realized the joy of being set free and living free as the Gospel becomes practical and attractive, creating a multiplying effect on men in the church and community.

											[The W.E.A.P.O.N.S. curriculum] really encouraged us to rally behind our pastor and pray for him. It showed our men to follow God's leadership and authority in our life and how to unite as one for a common purpose - God. After this weekend’s workshop the men re-united and came together setting aside their differences. It really made a difference.

It’s wonderful to see the many men from different Christian denominations participate. The exploratory presentation of the materials were clear, meaningful and comprehensible. Pastors whose Churches embrace this material lay the ground work for men using serious bible based materials which connects them with their God and fellow brothers, which promotes spiritual wellness in our church communities.
